    "### Parallel processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the hardest tutorial of the day. I have done the best I can to make it clear and simple as possible. It took me a very long time to understand it. I hope that this tutorial means you can understand parallel processing in a much shorter time than I can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel processing is highly important in bioinformatics and something that is often taken for granted. You might think you know how to parallel process by adding '-t 20' to the options of your command. But that doesn't help grip what's going on under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You only truly understand the benefits of parallel processing until you can no longer do it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This example generated here is taken with much influence from a fantastic stackover-flow [thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14533458/python-threading-multiple-bash-subprocesses).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of important parallel-processing in nanopore sequencing is extracting fastq information from a set of fast5 files. This can take up to a day...\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example today we will generate 200 commands that all take somewhere between 0 and 9 seconds to complete. We will run this in five parallel streams. This should roughly take one fifth of the time it would take if we were to do this with only one stream."
